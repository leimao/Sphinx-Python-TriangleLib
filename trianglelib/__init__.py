"""Routines for working with triangles.

The two modules inside of this package are packed with useful features
for the programmer who needs to support triangles:

``shape``
    This module provides a full-fledged `Triangle` object that can be
    instantiated and then asked to provide all sorts of information
    about its properties.

``utils``
    For the programmer in a hurry, this module offers quick functions
    that take as arguments the three side lengths of a triangle, and
    perform a quick computation without the programmer having to make
    the extra step of creating an object.
